    <h3>A dreamer's Reality</h3>
    <p>
        Whether it's crispy dose<br>
        Or trails in a jungle way<br>
        Eyes open early<br>
        At sharp six thirty<br>
        But only on Sunday<br>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="stars">
    <h3>A sparkle of hope</h3>
    <p>
        Gazing at the endless <br>
        Dark night sky<br>
        That surrounds me<br>
        Like a thick blanket<br>
        <br>
        A blanket made of velvet<br>
        Black velvet studded<br>
        With stars that sparkle<br>
        Brightly in your eyes<br>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="butterfly">
    <h3>Breaking Free</h3>
    <p>
        Have you ever seen a <br>
        butterfly stuck inside glass<br>
        How it tries and tries to <br>
        Fly away into the cheerful<br>
        <br>
        Sunshine, to feel its warm<br>
        Rays strike its wings<br>
        But getting struck by cold<br>
        glass instead and pushed back<br>
        into a realm of biting cold darkness<br>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="autumn">
    <h3>Golden Red and Brown</h3>
    <p>
        Soft breeze<br>
        rushes through the trees<br>
        wafting crispy leaves<br>
        to the blanket beneath my feet<br>
        <br>
        Little green leaves<br>
        At its tips growing<br>
        Feel it coming<br>
        And welcoming<br>
        <br>
        Dark green leaves<br>
        Right at the middle<br>
        afraid of falling<br>
        and withering<br>
        <br>
        The beardy old ones<br>
        Of golden red tones<br>
        Smiling at me<br>
        wanting to be free<br>
        <br>
        Let me go<br>
        And you will live<br>
        Thus saying<br>
        The rusty old leaves<br>
        Let go and fall asleep<br>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="rains">
    <h3>Rainy day vs me</h3>
    <p>
        When the heavens<br>
        Break up and pour<br>
        Down with lightning flashing<br>
        And thunder booming<br>
        <br>
        And chilly wind hits<br>
        You shiver and say<br>
        "Freezing cold day"<br>
        <br>
        Roads become rivers<br>
        And you walk on<br>
        rushing water with <br>
        rubber chappals and<br>
        A grey umbrella<br>
        <br>
        When hot soup and<br>
        hot snacks are devoured<br>
        with great relish<br>
        watching heavy rains through<br>
        frosted glass<br>
        <br>
        I'm sitting here<br>
        Reading, solving linear algebra!<br>
    </p>

    <div id="saveTrees">
    <h3>Tale of a tree</h3>
    <p>
        Have you ever spent<br>
        A quiet moment<br>
        listening to the stories<br>
        The rustle of the trees<br>
        <br>
        We'd been together<br>
        Since forever<br>
        Holding our hands<br>
        Deep under the sands<br>
        <br>
        Dancing under the moon<br>
        to the soft tune<br>
        of the cool breeze<br>
        Salty from the seas<br>
        <br>
        Giving what we had<br>
        Sharing what we got<br>
        If they had something of us too<br>
        I would still be by you<br>
        <br>
        That day had begun<br>
        With us lazing in the sun<br>
        That's when time came<br>
        With that dreadful pain<br>
        <br>
        Only I could feel<br>
        her agony as cold steel<br>
        made it's way deep<br>
        dragging her to sleep<br>
        <br>
        I still dance to the<br>
        notes of the breeze<br>
        And whisper to anyone<br>
        Who is willing to listen<br>
        The stories of my leaves<br>
        <br>
    </p>
</div>
<div id="krishna">
    <h3>Ratri</h3>
    <p>
        Her purple hair is done<br>
        Just right<br>
        Her creamy skin in<br>
        The spotlight<br>
        <br>
        My oily locks<br>
        In ugly tails<br>
        I grope in the dark<br>
        Camouflaged<br>
        <br>
        She takes the stage<br>
        With a flattering smile<br>
        Charms them all with<br>
        Her cunning style<br>
        <br>
        I watch her singing<br>
        Standing in the aisle<br>
        The thunderous cheer<br>
        Ringing in my ear<br>
        <br>
        I take a step forward<br>
        In uncertain fear<br>
        Well there is no one to laugh<br>
        No one to jeer<br>
        <br>
        With a racing heart<br>
        And a sinking spirit<br>
        I climb up the stage<br>
        With a raging calm<br>
        On my face<br>
        <br>
        Deafening silence and<br>
        A hall fully empty<br>
        Am I too early? Am I too late?<br>
        For I see nobody around<br>
    </p>

<div id="Winter">
    <h3>Frosted Windows</h3>
    <p>
        Winter is the favourite<br>
        Season of my year<br>
        The season when you get<br>
        Fogged and frosted<br>
        <br>
        The season when you<br>
        Get to reflect light<br>
        Warmth and joy<br>
        To rosy little brats<br>
        <br>
        ’Tis the festive season<br>
        When the aroma of cinnamon<br>
        And bread can bring the<br>
        Polar bears hibernating up north<br>
        To the delicious kitchen table<br>
        <br>
        The season when warm<br>
        Faces press on you<br>
        Watching papa working on<br>
        The Christmas tree<br>
        <br>
        The season when there is<br>
        Lively music and happy dance<br>
        A loving family and loving friends<br>
        And a beautiful present waiting to be opened<br>
        <br>
        This winter is harsh<br>
        And cold proving<br>
        To me that<br>
        Ice can burn<br>
        <br>
        My frosted glass<br>
        Is now frosted<br>
        Not with the cold snow<br>
        But with warm tears<br>
        <br>
        Scorching tears<br>
        From the eyes of<br>
        The happy faces<br>
        Picturing papa working on<br>
        The Christmas tree<br>
    </p>

<div id="blindfold">
    <h3>The Blindfold</h3>
    <p>
        When there’s nobody to ask<br>
        To even care if she smiles or cries<br>
        Her soul flutters, pining<br>
        For another blindfold over her eyes<br>
        <br>
        To shut her eyes tightly<br>
        From the fierce rays of truth<br>
        She longs for a warm hug<br>
        Off the strong arms of a youth<br>
        <br>
        He edges into her dreams<br>
        Stroking her hair softly, coming close<br>
        But she knows her vision's blurring<br>
        That love's a poppy and not a rose<br>
        <br>
        She looks into troubled waters<br>
        With ripples her reflections clouded<br>
        But her image remained constant<br>
        Even when tranquility settled<br>
        <br>
        To believe that she too<br>
        Will grow up to be a swan one day<br>
        And a prince Hans will take her<br>
        To a dreamland far away<br>
        <br>
        To believe that the prince<br>
        Feeding the goat today<br>
        Wouldn't bait it tomorrow<br>
        As his hunting prey<br>
        <br>
        No, She’s a lone lioness<br>
        With a fire burning inside<br>
        The queen of her own forest<br>
        Despondent emptiness beside<br>
        <br>
        Cuz reality’s not the soft waves<br>
        That play tag with your tiny feet<br>
        It's the Tsunami that hits hard<br>
        Drowning every house every street<br>
        <br>
        The world's full of crooks and <br>
        Liars and cold and the selfish<br>
        Love blinds, it's like the chocolate<br>
        A diabetic would relish<br>
        <br>
        Well it'll always be winter<br>
        With people wrapping their eyes<br> 
        With layers and layers of silk<br>
        Woven of false hopes and smiles<br>
        <br>
        With warm smiles hiding<br>
        Cold intentions and hearts bare<br>
        Pouring brimming words, She longs for<br>
        Someone to love, someone to care<br>

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>
        A sweet little girl<br>
        Smiles back at me<br>
        Skipping stones on water<br>
        Hopping across the field<br>
        <br>
        Amidst the yellow tulips<br>
        Singing merrily as she walks<br>
        With hands around dad's finger<br>
        Laughing as he talks<br>
        <br>
        A nervous young girl<br>
        In uniform tie and shoes<br>
        Looks at me pleading<br>
        Desperate for an excuse<br>
        <br>
        A blushing young maiden<br>
        Looks at me once more<br>
        Hoping he will notices<br>
        She leaves sighing, unsure<br>
        <br>
        A tired young woman<br>
        Dark circles under her eyes<br>
        Give yourself a break I say<br>
        Quite late when we realize<br>
        <br>
        A strong old woman<br>
        Having hiked many a peak<br>
        Sings and claps kissing<br>
        Softly her granddaughter's cheek<br>
        <br>
        A wise old woman<br>
        Oh that's me!<br>
        Stares back from the mirror<br>
        Reflecting, smiles broadly <br>
